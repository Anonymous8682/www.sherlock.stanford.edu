## Installation requests

!!! warning "Custom software installations"

    The SRCC team installs, for general use, a set of libraries, tools and
    software applications that are commonly used across many research groups.
    However, our staff resources are quite limited and don't allow us to build
    nor maintain custom software applications that may be requested by or be of
    use to a small number of users.

We strongly encourage users to build custom and field- or domain-specific
software themselves, and install it in their own [personal or group shared
directories](../storage). That way, they can share the software installations with the
rest of the users in their group, if necessary.

Users may even maintain and publish their own [local module
files](modules#custom-modules) to dynamically configure a running environment
to use the software. They could share those modules with other users to
simplify the use of their own custom software installations.

If the software you need is not in the [list of available software](list),
please [contact us][url_contact] with **complete details about the package**,
and we will try to help you install it.

If it's a widely used software that could benefit multiple users across
different scientific communities, we will consider install it globally as
resources permit[^install_req].

[^install_req]: Software requests, including version upgrades, are fulfilled in
  the order they are received, and as time permits. We don't have any dedicated
  team for software installations, and requests are handled along with other
  duties, typically within two to three weeks of being received.
