# Software list

The full list of software centrally installed and managed on Sherlock is in the
tables below.

!!! todo "Work in progress"

    Software installations on Sherlock are an ever ongoing process. We're
    continuously adding new software to the list. If you're looking for
    something that is not in the list, please take a look
    [here][url_installations] for options.

Software modules on Sherlock are organized in *categories*, by scientific
field. It means that you will have to first load a category module before
getting access to individual modules.  The `math` and `devel` categories are
loaded by default. See the [Modules page][url_modules] for further details and
examples.
