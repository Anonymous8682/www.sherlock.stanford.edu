# Software list

You'll find the full list of software that are centrally installed and managed on
Sherlock in the tables below.

!!! tip "Module categories"

    As described in the [Modules page][url_modules], software modules are
    organized in *categories*, meaning that you will have to first load the
    category module before getting access to individual modules.  The `math`
    and `devel` categories are loaded by default.
