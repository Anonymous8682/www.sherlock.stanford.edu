# Software list

You'll find the full list of software that are centrally installed and managed
on Sherlock in the tables below.

!!! warning "Work in progress"

    Software installations on Sherlock is an ever ongoing process. We're
    continuously adding new software to the list. If you're looking for
    something that is not in the list, please take a look at the [Installation
    page](installation) for more details.

As described in the [Modules page][url_modules], software modules are organized
in *categories*, meaning that you will have to first load the category module
before getting access to individual modules.  The `math` and `devel` categories
are loaded by default.
