## Welcome to Sherlock!

Sherlock is a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster, operated by the
[Stanford Research Computing Center][url_srcc] to provide computing resources to the
Stanford community at large. You'll find all the documentation, tips, FAQs and
information about Sherlock here.

<!-- just in case -->

!!! note "Sherlock 1.0"
    The information on these pages mostly focus on Sherlock 2.0, the new
    iteration of the Sherlock cluster. For anything related to Sherlock 1.0,
    please see the previous [wiki][url_wiki.


Feel free to explore the different sections, and suggest new ones if you feel
some information is missing, by [contacting us][url_contact].
