## How to submit a successful support request

If you're facing issues you can't figure out, we're here to help. Feel free to
email us at research-computing-support@stanford.edu, but please keep the
following points in mind to ensure a timely and relevant response to your
support requests.

We need to understand the issue you're facing, and in most cases, we need to be
able to reproduce it, so it could be diagnosed and addressed. So, lease make
sure to provide enough information so we could help you as best as possible.

This typically involves providing the following information:

* your SUNet ID
* the command(s) you ran, and/or the job submission script(s) you used
* the **exact**, **full** error message (or trace) you received.

    !!! bug "Error messages are critical"

        This is very important. Without proper error messages, there is nothing we
        can do to help. And *it doesn't work* is not a proper error message.

* the name of node where you received the error (usually displayed in your
  command-line prompt)
* if relevant, the full path to the files involved in your question or problem
