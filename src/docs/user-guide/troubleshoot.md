## How to submit a support request

If you're facing issues you can't figure out, we're here to help. Feel free to
email us at srcc-support@stanford.edu, but please keep the following points in
mind to ensure a timely and relevant response to your support requests.

!!! warning "Please provide relevant information"

    We need to understand the issue you're facing, and in most cases, we need
    to be able to reproduce it, so it could be diagnosed and addressed.
    Please make sure to provide enough information so we could help you in the
    best possible way.

This typically involves providing the following information:

* your SUNet ID,
* some context about your problem (were you submitting a job, copying a file,
  compiling an application?),
* if relevant, the full path to the files involved in your question or problem,
* the name of node where you received the error (usually displayed in your
  command-line prompt),
* the command(s) you ran, and/or the job submission script(s) you used,
* the **exact**, **entire** error message (or trace) you received.

!!! danger "Error messages are critical"

    This is very important. Without proper error messages, there is nothing
    we can do to help. And "*it doesn't work*" is not a proper error
    message.


You can avoid email back and forth where we ask for all the relevant details,
which would delay the problem resolution, by providing all this information
from the start, which will help us get to your problem immediately.
