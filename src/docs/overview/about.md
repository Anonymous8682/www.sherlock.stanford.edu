# About us

## SRCC

The Stanford Research Computing Center ([SRCC][url_srcc]) is a joint effort of
the [Dean of Research]() and [IT Services][url_uit] to build and support a
comprehensive program to advance computational research at Stanford.  That
includes offering and supporting traditional high performance computing (HPC)
systems, as well as systems for high throughput and data-intensive computing.

The SRCC also helps researchers transition their analyses and models from the
desktop to more capable and plentiful resources, providing the opportunity to
explore their data and answer research questions at a scale typically not
possible on desktops or departmental servers. Partnering with national
initiatives like NSF [XSEDE][url_xsede] program as well as vendors, the SRCC
offers training and learning opportunities around HPC tools and technologies.

For more information, please see the [SRCC website][url_srcc]

## Acknowledgment / citation

It is important and expected that publications resulting from computations
performed on Sherlock acknowledge this. The following wording is suggested:

!!! cite "Acknowledgment"

    Some of the computing for this project was performed on the Sherlock
    cluster.  We would like to thank Stanford University and the Stanford
    Research Computing Center for providing computational resources and support
    that contributed to these research results.


## Support

### Email

Research Computing support can be reached by sending an email to

## Sherlock, of HBO fame

And finally, we couldn't resist to the pleasure of citing the most
prestigious accomplishment of Sherlock to date: a mention in [HBO's Silicon
Valley][url_sv] [Season 4 finale][url_ep38]!

Yep, you got that right, [Richard Hendricks][url_richard] wanted to use our
very own Sherlock. Kudos to the show's crew and whomever did the research and
got it right, you made our day.
