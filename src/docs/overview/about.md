# About us

## SRCC

The Stanford Research Computing Center ([SRCC][url_srcc]) is a joint effort of
the [Dean of Research]() and [IT Services][url_uit] to build and support a
comprehensive program to advance computational research at Stanford.  That
includes offering and supporting traditional high performance computing (HPC)
systems, as well as systems for high throughput and data-intensive computing.

The SRCC also helps researchers transition their analyses and models from the
desktop to more capable and plentiful resources, providing the opportunity to
explore their data and answer research questions at a scale typically not
possible on desktops or departmental servers. Partnering with national
initiatives like NSF [XSEDE][url_xsede] program as well as vendors, the SRCC
offers training and learning opportunities around HPC tools and technologies.

For more information, please see the [SRCC website][url_srcc]
