## How to request an account

To request an account, the sponsoring Stanford faculty member should email
mailto:research-computing-support@stanford.edu, specifying the names and SUNet
IDs (usernames) of his/her research team members needing an account.

Sherlock is open to the Stanford community as a computing resource to support
departmental or sponsored research, thus a faculty member's explicit consent is
required for account requests.

!!! warning "Sherlock is a resource for research"

    Sherlock is not suitable for course work, class assignments or general-use
    training sessions.
